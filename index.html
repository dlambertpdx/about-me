        <h2>Attacus Atlas</h2>
        <p>
            Attacus atlas, the Atlas moth, is a large saturniid moth endemic
            to the forests of Asia. The species was first described by Carl
            Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae.

        <h2>Life Cycle of the Atlas Moth</h2>
        <ol id="lifecycle-list">
            <li>
                <span id="lifeCycle">Mating</span> Females release powerful
                pheromones through a gland on the end of the abdomen to
                attract a mate. The female does not stray far from the
                location of her discarded cocoon. She seeks out a perch
                where the air currents will best carry her pheromones. Males
                can detect and home in on these pheromones from several
                kilometers away using chemoreceptors located on their
                feathery antennae. Once fertilized, the female lays a number
                of spherical eggs, 2.5 mm (0.098 in) in diameter, on the
                undersides of the leaves of food plants.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span id="lifeCycle">Larva</span> Dusty-green caterpillars
                hatch after approximately two weeks and feed voraciously on
                the foliage of citrus, cinnamon, guava, and evergreen trees.
                The caterpillars can grow to 11.5 cm (4.5 in) in length and
                2.5 cm (0.98 in) in thickness. They are adorned with white,
                waxy, fleshy spines along their backs, which become more
                prominent at later instars. Beside the prolegs on the last
                abdominal segment, there is a large green spot surrounded by
                an orange ring.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span id="lifeCycle">Pupa</span> After reaching a length of
                about 11.5 cm (4.5 in), the caterpillars are ready to
                pupate. They spin a 7-8 cm long papery cocoon interwoven
                with desiccated leaves and attach it to a twig using a
                strand of silk. The adult moths emerge from the cocoon after
                approximately four weeks depending on environmental factors.
            </li>
            <li>
                <span id="lifeCycle">Imago</span> Male Atlas moth Adult
                Atlas moths are weak, unsteady fliers. To conserve energy,
                the moths rest during the day and fly at night. As they lack
                fully formed mouthparts, the adults cannot eat, subsisting
                entirely on fat reserves accumulated during the larval
                stage. As a result, they live for only a few days during
                which their sole objective is seeking out a mate. Adults may
                be found on wing throughout the year but are most abundant
                between November and January.

        <h2 class="blurbTitle">Etymology</h2>
        <p class="blurbContent">
            Atlas moths are named after either Atlas, the Titan of Greek
            mythology (due to their size), or their map-like wing patterns.
            In Hong Kong, the Cantonese means "snake's head moth", referring
            to the prominent extension of the forewing which bears
            resemblance to the head of a snake.

        <h2 class="blurbTitle">Trivia</h2>
        <p class="blurbContent">
            The Japanese subspecies A. a. ryukyuensis, native to Yonaguni in
            the Yaeyama Islands, may have served as inspiration for the
            movie monster Mothra.
