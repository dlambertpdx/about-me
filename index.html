            <h2>Attacus Atlas</h2>
            <p>
                Attacus atlas, the Atlas moth, is a large saturniid moth endemic
                to the forests of Asia. The species was first described by Carl
                Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of Systema Naturae.

            <h2>Etymology</h2>
            <p>
                Atlas moths are named after either Atlas, the Titan of Greek
                mythology (due to their size), or their map-like wing patterns.
                In Hong Kong, the Cantonese means "snake's head moth", referring
                to the prominent extension of the forewing which bears
                resemblance to the head of a snake.

            <h2>Trivia</h2>
            <p>
                The Japanese subspecies A. a. ryukyuensis, native to Yonaguni in
                the Yaeyama Islands, may have served as inspiration for the
                movie monster Mothra.

            <h2>Life Cycle of the Atlas Moth</h2>
            <ol id="lifecycle-list">
                <li>
                    <span id="lifeCycle">Mating : </span> Females release powerful
                    pheromones through a gland on the end of the abdomen to
                    attract a mate. The female does not stray far from the
                    location of her discarded cocoon. She seeks out a perch
                    where the air currents will best carry her pheromones. Males
                    can detect and home in on these pheromones from several
                    kilometers away using chemoreceptors located on their
                    feathery antennae. Once fertilized, the female lays a number
                    of spherical eggs, 2.5 mm (0.098 in) in diameter, on the
                    undersides of the leaves of food plants.

                    <span id="lifeCycle">Larva : </span> Dusty-green caterpillars
                    hatch after approximately two weeks and feed voraciously on
                    the foliage of citrus, cinnamon, guava, and evergreen trees.
                    The caterpillars can grow to 11.5 cm (4.5 in) in length and
                    2.5 cm (0.98 in) in thickness. They are adorned with white,
                    waxy, fleshy spines along their backs, which become more
                    prominent at later instars. Beside the prolegs on the last
                    abdominal segment, there is a large green spot surrounded by
                    an orange ring.

                    <span id="lifeCycle">Pupa : </span> After reaching a length of
                    about 11.5 cm (4.5 in), the caterpillars are ready to
                    pupate. They spin a 7-8 cm long papery cocoon interwoven
                    with desiccated leaves and attach it to a twig using a
                    strand of silk. The adult moths emerge from the cocoon after
                    approximately four weeks depending on environmental factors.

                    Atlas moths are weak, unsteady fliers. To conserve energy,
                    the moths rest during the day and fly at night. As they lack
                    fully formed mouthparts, the adults cannot eat, subsisting
                    entirely on fat reserves accumulated during the larval
                    stage. As a result, they live for only a few days during
                    which their sole objective is seeking out a mate. Adults may
                    be found on wing throughout the year but are most abundant
                    between November and January.
